# Conflict Plan

## Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

## Describe at least:

1. What will be your groupâ€™s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
- When a person has a disagreement or conflict of opinion, we will first probe the issue, assert each other to reach the desired outcome.
- Take time individually to assess the situation and see the issue in its entirety. 
- Meta communicate to address the team communication process. 
- The prime directive is priority one.

2. What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
- Open communication is key, each person must speak up regarding their issues.
- We will have a morning briefing to address any concerns.
- Do a final briefing at the end of each day.  

3. How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
- We are all here to learn and to give it our best. 
- We will do everything we can to help each other out while keeping in mind the time constraint.

4. How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
- We will communicate this issue during our morning and end of day briefing.
- Hold group intervention in the worst case. 

5. How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
- We will involve the instructor to help address this issue. 
- When all the attempts fail we will do a one on one communication to resolve this issue.
